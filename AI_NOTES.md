# AI Development Notes

## AI Tools Used
- **Agentic AI Assistant**: Used for end-to-end scaffolding, code generation, refactoring, and documentation.
- **Tools**: Replaced manual terminal commands and file editing with automated agent actions.

## Usage
- **Code Generation**: All Python (FastAPI, RAG logic), HTML/JS/CSS (Frontend), and Docker configuration were initially generated by the AI.
- **Refactoring**: The `rag.py` module was refactored by the AI to strictly adhere to function signature requirements (`ingest_document`, `query_documents`) and to implement strict context grounding.
- **Documentation**: README and implementation plans were auto-generated.

## Manual Verification & Edits
- **Structure**: Verified directory structure (`app/`, `data/`, `static/`).
- **Imports**: Verified Python import paths.
- **Manual Edits**: 
    - `app/storage.py`: Reformatted/Saved by user.
    - `static/index.html`: Reformatted/Saved by user.

## Technology Choices

### LLM Provider: OpenAI
**Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
**Reason**: Chosen for its balance of speed, cost-effectiveness, and capability in reasoning over retrieved context. It follows system instructions well for RAG applications where the context is provided directly.

### Embeddings: OpenAI
**Model**: `text-embedding-3-small`
**Reason**: High-performance embedding model that provides a smaller vector dimension (1536) while maintaining excellent semantic search capabilities. It is cost-effective and integrates natively with the chosen LLM provider.
