Create a clean RAG pipeline module in Python.

Functions required:

ingest_document(text, doc_name)
- chunk text
- embed chunks
- store in chromadb with metadata doc_name

query_documents(question)
- embed question
- retrieve top 3 chunks
- call LLM with prompt template
- return answer + sources

Use:
- chromadb persistent client
- OpenAI embeddings
- OpenAI chat completion

Include prompt template that forces grounded answers only from context.
If answer not found → say "Not found in documents".



==================================================================================



Create a minimal HTML + JS frontend for a FastAPI RAG app.

Pages:

Home page:
- upload document form
- list uploaded documents
- question input
- answer display
- sources display

Status page:
- calls /health endpoint
- shows green/red status for:
  backend
  vector db
  llm key

Use:
- vanilla HTML
- minimal CSS
- fetch API
- no frameworks

Must be clean and readable.



===========================================================================




Write a professional README.md for a Private Knowledge Q&A web app.

Include:
- project overview
- features
- architecture
- how to run locally
- docker run instructions
- environment variables
- hosting instructions (Render)
- what is implemented
- what is not implemented



===========================================================================


Write AI_NOTES.md explaining:

- which AI tools were used
- what they were used for
- what was manually verified
- what code was edited by hand
- LLM provider used and why
- embedding model used and why

Keep honest and professional.





==============================================================================








Generate a PROMPTS_USED.md template that logs prompts used during development.

Sections:
- backend prompts
- frontend prompts
- docker prompts
- debugging prompts

Leave placeholders for user to paste prompts.
Do not include AI responses.


==========================================================================
Create ABOUTME.md template with:
